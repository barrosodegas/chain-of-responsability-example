# Kotlin Project to exemplify the use of the chain of responsibility design pattern

- This project aims to demonstrate two ways to build a data processing chain using the project pattern, chain of responsibility.
- In this project you will find an implementation that shows a manual way to create the processing chain. The other implementation method shows the processing current being carried by spring. In both ways you can define the order of execution and loading of the chain.
- The execution of the processors were implemented only by BDD tests to demonstrate their operation.
- This design pattern can be applied to different situations. One is data validation when we need to validate an entire group of information before returning an error.
